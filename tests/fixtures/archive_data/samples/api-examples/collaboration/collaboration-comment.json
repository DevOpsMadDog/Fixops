The vulnerable log4j method is called from our PaymentController when logging transaction details.\n\n**Impact Assessment:**\n- Severity: Critical\n- Exploitability: High (public exploits available)\n- Business Impact: Could lead to RCE and data breach\n\n**Recommended Actions:**\n1. Immediate: Apply WAF rules to block JNDI lookup patterns\n2. Short-term: Upgrade log4j-core to 2.17.1\n3. Verify fix with security scan\n\nI'll create a PR for the dependency update today.",
