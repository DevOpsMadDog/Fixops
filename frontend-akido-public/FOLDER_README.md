# frontend-akido-public/

**Purpose:** Legacy public frontend prototype used for storytelling/reference. Not actively maintained.

**Gotchas**
- Contains build artefacts; run `npm install` in a clean environment if you plan to revive it.
- Keep changes isolatedâ€”no automated tests currently cover this frontend.
