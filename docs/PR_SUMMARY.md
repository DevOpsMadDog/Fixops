# Pull Request Summary

This document captures the scope of the FixOps consolidation branch so reviewers can grok the cumulative impact across market research, architecture, runtime capabilities, simulations, and hardening efforts.

## Product & Market Deliverables

- **Market analysis** – `market/MARKET_REPORT.md`, `market/COMP_MATRIX.csv`, `market/USP_ENHANCEMENTS.md`, and `market/POSITIONING.md` benchmark FixOps against Aikido Security, Apiiro, and Vulcan Cyber, outline ICP pain points, and articulate the "context-first, audit-ready" wedge we pursue.
- **Packaging & pricing** – Overlay defaults and `market/PRICING.md` expose demo vs. enterprise limits, onboarding checklists, and ROI proof points to keep time-to-value under 30 minutes while signalling expansion pathways.
- **GTM storytelling** – `market/GTM_PLAN.md` and `market/DEMO_STORY.md` frame the customer journey from first artefact push through evidence bundling, aligning with the product experiences implemented in this branch.

## Architecture & Documentation

- **Repository inventory** – `index/INVENTORY.csv` and `index/graph.json` map every module, language, and import chain.
- **Folder orientation** – Each directory now ships a `FOLDER_README.md` describing purpose, inputs/outputs, and gotchas to shorten onboarding.
- **Deep documentation set** – Architecture, data model, integrations, SSDLC mapping, security posture, CTEM assessment, configuration guide, runbook, HTML usage guide, and academic research briefs live under `docs/`.
- **Line-by-line walkthrough** – `docs/LINE_BY_LINE.md` explains behaviour for core modules to accelerate code review and auditing.

## Platform Capabilities

- **Overlay-driven core** – `core/configuration.py` loads declarative profiles covering authentication, directories, guardrail maturity, module toggles, onboarding checklists, compliance packs, AI agent watchlists, exploit feeds, probabilistic priors, SSDLC targets, module registry metadata, and pricing tiers.
- **Push ingestion & normalisation** – Hardened FastAPI uploads in `apps/api/app.py` validate API keys, MIME types, and byte limits before staging artefacts for the orchestrator. `apps/api/normalizers.py` unifies design, SBOM, CVE, and SARIF parsing with case-insensitive crosswalk mapping.
- **Pipeline orchestration** – `apps/api/pipeline.py` coordinates guardrails, context engine, policy automation, compliance packs, SSDLC scoring, IaC posture, AI agent detection, exploitability assessment, probabilistic forecasting, ROI analytics, tenant lifecycle reporting, performance simulation, onboarding guidance, pricing summaries, module execution matrices, and evidence bundling.
- **Context & scoring engines** – Modules in `core/` provide business context scoring, guardrail evaluation, compliance coverage, AI agent detection, exploit intelligence, SSDLC stage assessments, IaC posture analysis, Bayesian/Markov forecasts, ROI dashboards, tenant lifecycle orchestration, performance modelling, and module management with custom hook execution.
- **Automation connectors** – `core/connectors.py` includes Jira, Confluence, and Slack delivery paths with masked credential logging and structured outcomes. Policy planners persist manifests to disk for auditing.
- **Evidence hub & feedback** – `core/evidence.py` composes bundles with compression limits, redaction, and manifest auditing while `core/feedback.py` records JSONL feedback when overlay toggles permit.
- **Exploit feed refresh** – `core/exploit_signals.py` can auto-refresh KEV/EPSS data into allowlisted directories, annotating CVE entries with staleness metadata.
- **CLI parity** – `core/cli.py` mirrors API behaviour for offline runs, module toggling, environment overrides, and optional evidence export.

## Simulations, Performance, and Testing

- **CVE-2021-44228 simulation** – `simulations/cve_scenario/runner.py` contrasts demo vs. enterprise rescoring with evidence bundles, reinforcing the contextual story from the market report.
- **Performance notes** – `perf/BASELINE.md`, `perf/BENCHMARKS.csv`, and `perf/CHANGES.md` track pipeline hotspots and the impact of caching/token reuse.
- **Tests** – Comprehensive pytest coverage spans overlay parsing, CLI execution, API endpoints, evidence handling, exploit signals, AI agents, probabilistic forecasts, connectors, and end-to-end scenarios.

## Remaining Enterprise Gaps

- Execute policy actions asynchronously against live Jira/Confluence instances and capture callbacks for closed-loop automation.
- Provide historical analytics storage (forecasts, exploit snapshots, ticket metrics) plus ROI dashboards for executives.
- Add multi-tenant overlay lifecycle tooling (versioning, RBAC, approvals) and production-grade retention of artefacts/evidence.

## Reviewer Checklist

- Boot locally with `uvicorn backend.app:create_app --factory --reload` and issue push uploads followed by `/pipeline/run`.
- Exercise the CLI `python -m fixops.cli run ...` path for offline validation.
- Execute `pytest` and optionally `python -m compileall backend fixops simulations tests` to confirm coverage.

These notes should be reflected in the PR body so reviewers grasp how FixOps now delivers an overlay-configurable, audit-focused risk operations platform.
