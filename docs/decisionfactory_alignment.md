# DecisionFactory.ai Alignment Status

This document tracks the implementation status of the DecisionFactory.ai requirements across the FixOps codebase. To reduce cognitive load, the alignment work is now split into three parts that can be reviewed independently:

- **Part 1 – Implemented capabilities:** Everything DecisionFactory.ai already gets out-of-the-box.
- **Part 2 – Partially implemented capabilities:** Workstreams that are in motion but still have visible gaps.
- **Part 3 – Missing capabilities:** Features that have not yet been started.

## Part 1 – Implemented capabilities ✅

See [`Part 1 – Implemented capabilities`](decisionfactory_alignment/part-1-implemented.md) for the full breakdown of production-ready features.

---

## Part 2 – Completed capabilities ✅

See [`Part 2 – Completed capabilities`](decisionfactory_alignment/part-2-completed.md) for the detailed list of DecisionFactory workstreams that have now shipped in FixOps.

## Part 3 – Completed capabilities ✅

See [`Part 3 – Completed capabilities`](decisionfactory_alignment/part-3-completed.md) for the closing wave of DecisionFactory.ai workstreams now shipped in FixOps.

### Summary
DecisionFactory alignment is now complete end-to-end. Production OPA gating,
explainable narratives, reinforcement learning, supplier VEX suppression,
signed evidence bundles, and multi-tenant RBAC all ship alongside the earlier
Part 1 and Part 2 deliverables.
