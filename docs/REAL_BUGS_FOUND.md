# Real Bugs Found During Comprehensive E2E Audit with Real Data

**Date:** 2025-11-01  
**Audit Type:** Comprehensive E2E testing with real CVE data, real SBOMs, real SARIF files  
**Purpose:** Find real-world bugs that wrapper programs and mocked tests don't catch

## Bug #1: NoneType AttributeError in Markov Projection

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** `core/processing_layer.py:199` and `core/processing_layer.py:212`  
**Found By:** Real KEV data testing  

**Description:**  
When processing real KEV CVE data, the code attempts to call `.lower()` on `None` values when CVE records have missing or null severity fields. The real CISA KEV feed contains CVE records where the severity field can be None or missing.

**Error:**
```
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower'
```

**Root Cause:**  
The code uses `record.get("severity", "medium").lower()` which returns None when the severity field exists but is None, then tries to call `.lower()` on None.

**Fix:**  
Changed to `(record.get("severity") or "medium").lower()` to properly handle None values.

**Impact:**  
- Pipeline crashes when processing real KEV data
- Affects both mchmm and heuristic Markov projection paths
- Prevents any analysis when real CVE data contains None severities

**Test Case:**  
Real CISA KEV feed with 1453 CVEs exposed this bug immediately.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

## Testing Progress

### Phase 1: Real Data Preparation ‚úÖ
- [x] Fetched real KEV feed (1453 CVEs)
- [x] Fetched real EPSS feed (100 entries)
- [x] Created real CycloneDX SBOM
- [x] Created real SPDX SBOM
- [x] Created real SARIF from Semgrep
- [x] Created real design context

### Phase 2: CLI Testing üîÑ
- [x] Test CLI run command - **FOUND BUG #1**
- [ ] Test CLI demo command (enterprise mode)
- [ ] Test CLI make-decision command
- [ ] Test CLI health command
- [ ] Test CLI show-overlay command
- [ ] Test CLI train-forecast command
- [ ] Test CLI copy-evidence command
- [ ] Test CLI stage-run command

## Next Steps

1. Re-run CLI test to find next bug
2. Continue systematic testing of all entry points
3. Document complete program flows
4. Audit and fix IaC
5. Create comprehensive flow diagrams
6. Identify dead code
7. Create PR with all fixes and documentation
