# Closed-Loop Optimization (CLO) Response for FixOps

This note distills a pragmatic response for stakeholders asking about FixOps' closed-loop optimization roadmap. It quantifies the effort to mature "closed-loop" automation and highlights levers to optimize delivery without inflating risk.

## Current Signals
- **Automation foundations** – Policy execution, evidence bundling, and feedback capture already exist through the pipeline orchestrator, connectors, and evidence hub. These services give us telemetry hooks for closed-loop learning without fresh plumbing.
- **Probabilistic context** – Bayesian/Markov modelling and exploit signal refresh are live, so outcome data can be fused back into decision scoring once feedback ingress is wired into retraining jobs.

## Effort Guesstimate
| Workstream | Scope | Est. Effort | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Feedback normalisation | Harmonise review/ticket callbacks into structured feedback artefacts, wired to the evidence hub. | 1.5 engineer-weeks | Build atop existing JSONL feedback capture and policy manifests. |
| Outcome ingestion service | Persist remediation status and SLAs via async worker, expand connectors for Jira/Confluence webhooks. | 2 engineer-weeks | Extend existing policy automation connectors with webhook handlers and retries. |
| Model retraining loop | Schedule Bayesian prior/Markov matrix updates using captured feedback, expose metrics in analytics module. | 2 engineer-weeks | Reuse probabilistic module scaffolding; focus on guardrail-safe retraining cadence. |
| ROI dashboards | Surface closure velocity, noise reduction, and SLA adherence inside analytics/performance modules. | 1 engineer-week | Hook into existing analytics/performance instrumentation paths. |

**Total:** ~6.5 engineer-weeks across a two-sprint window assuming 60–70% allocation.

## Optimisation Levers
1. **Leverage existing manifests** – Evidence bundles and policy automation already generate signed manifests. Reuse them as correlation IDs rather than inventing new schemas.
2. **Phase connectors** – Start with Jira (largest install base) before rolling additional webhook handlers to reduce early integration overhead.
3. **Batch retraining** – Run daily retraining jobs with cached exploit/feedback deltas to minimise compute costs while keeping context fresh.
4. **Analytics reuse** – Extend the performance and analytics modules to visualise closure metrics; avoid building a net-new reporting surface.
5. **Guardrail-first rollout** – Pilot CLO features in demo tenants with synthetic datasets before enabling enterprise overlays to de-risk production adoption.

## Success Metrics
- Median remediation time improved by ≥25% against baseline within pilot tenants.
- Guardrail auto-closure accuracy above 90% once feedback-driven retraining is active.
- Noise reduction (muted or downgraded alerts) improves by ≥15% while maintaining auditability.

Delivering this CLO roadmap should keep FixOps' positioning around contextual, audit-ready automation while demonstrating measurable ROI for security and platform leaders.
