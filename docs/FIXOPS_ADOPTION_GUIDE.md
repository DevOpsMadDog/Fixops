# FixOps Adoption Playbook

FixOps becomes inevitable when organizations exhaust manual controls across regulatory, operational, and AI-driven risk domains. This refreshed playbook turns those breaking points into a cross-functional rollout blueprint that highlights ownership, timing, and measurable success.

## Trigger-to-Action Control Board

| Trigger Area | Leading Indicator | Immediate FixOps Actions | Success Signal | Accountable Lead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Regulatory & Board Escalations | Board escalations, new supervisory guidance, M&A diligence | Launch a 2-week FixOps discovery sprint to map obligations into compliance scorecards and automated evidence packs | Auto-generated audit packets reviewed in the next governance meeting | CISO / Compliance Lead |
| Pipeline & Triage Overload | Scanner noise >50%, backlog SLA breaches, release freezes | Connect CI/CD, SBOM, and scanner feeds to FixOps context pipeline; enable guardrail-aware triage | 60% reduction in noise, 40% faster remediation within 30 days | DevSecOps / Platform |
| Audit Evidence & Policy Automation | Manual evidence requests, waiver backlogs, failed control attestations | Codify SSDLC guardrails in FixOps Policy Planner and schedule evidence exports per release train | Zero manual spreadsheet hunts and on-demand auditor packets | Compliance Program Manager |
| Executive ROI & Telemetry Demands | CFO ROI mandates, enterprise OKR refresh, cost-cut directives | Instrument FixOps ROI dashboards, align KPIs with finance scorecards, publish executive-ready telemetry | Quarterly report shows quantified productivity & risk ROI | Security Operations Lead + FP&A |
| AI Agent Governance | Agentic AI pilots without controls, regulator inquiries, model prompt incidents | Onboard AI projects into FixOps AI Agent Advisor; apply recommended guardrails and evidence streams | AI guardrails enforced with documented oversight trails | AI Program Owner |

## Persona-Centric Adoption Plays

- **CISO / Compliance Officer**
  - Secure executive sponsorship by packaging regulatory obligations into FixOps scorecards.
  - Establish automated evidence runs for the next audit window; share sample bundles with audit partners.
  - Measure: audit cycle time, number of manual waivers, board satisfaction score.

- **DevSecOps & Platform Engineering**
  - Prioritize the noisiest pipeline and integrate FixOps correlation services ahead of manual triage queues.
  - Run canary deployments with guardrail-aware tickets to prove cycle-time gains before scaling.
  - Measure: deployment wait times, percentage of prioritized findings with context, guardrail adherence rates.

- **Product & Engineering Leaders**
  - Map FixOps outputs to engineering OKRs so security insights appear inside existing planning cadences.
  - Partner with program management to automate exception management workflows through FixOps policies.
  - Measure: time saved per release planning session, escalations avoided, throughput impact.

- **Finance / FP&A Partners**
  - Co-design ROI dashboards and baseline cost-to-remediate and audit prep labor hours.
  - Present FixOps impact in QBRs to maintain funding and align on future automation targets.
  - Measure: labor hours reclaimed, budget variance, risk-adjusted ROI.

## 30/60/90 Day Rollout Plan

- **Days 0–30: Foundation**
  - Stand up the adoption squad and document the top three triggers causing “cry for help” escalations.
  - Integrate FixOps with identity, issue tracking, and CI/CD for the highest-risk product line.
  - Deliver first telemetry snapshot (noise reduction, remediation speed, audit readiness).

- **Days 31–60: Expansion**
  - Expand guardrail libraries to cover critical policies (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001, AI ethics requirements).
  - Automate evidence bundles per release train; test export workflows with internal audit.
  - Publish ROI dashboards for finance review and align on quarterly reporting cadence.

- **Days 61–90: Scale & Institutionalize**
  - Roll FixOps context pipeline across remaining SDLC stages and multi-cloud assets.
  - Onboard AI workloads into the AI Agent Advisor with defined guardrail tiers.
  - Formalize continuous improvement rituals (monthly retros, quarterly exec updates).

## Integration Checklist

1. **Source Systems Connected** – CI/CD pipelines, scanner feeds, SBOM repositories, cloud telemetry.
2. **Policy Packs Enabled** – SOC 2, ISO 27001, internal SSDLC guardrails, AI oversight policies.
3. **Evidence Automation** – Scheduled exports mapped to compliance calendars and audit asks.
4. **Workflow Automation** – Guardrail-aware tickets routed to existing planning tools (Jira, Azure DevOps, etc.).
5. **Analytics & ROI** – Dashboards configured for security leadership, finance partners, and program managers.

## Change Management & Risk Mitigation

- Establish a FixOps champion network inside each delivery tribe to socialize new guardrails.
- Document a waiver process within FixOps to prevent shadow exceptions.
- Pair training with telemetry: every enablement session should point to the dashboard that proves value.
- Maintain a feedback backlog for platform improvements and review it in monthly adoption retrospectives.

## Continuous Measurement

- Track operational KPIs (noise reduction, remediation speed, audit readiness) alongside financial KPIs (labor hours reclaimed, risk-adjusted ROI) and governance KPIs (guardrail coverage, AI oversight completeness).
- Share a quarterly FixOps adoption scorecard with executives, highlighting wins, upcoming integrations, and remaining risks.

Use this matrix during steering reviews to confirm every flagship FixOps feature is both deployed and measured. When any cell lags, pull the associated playbook actions forward so no capability stalls during rollout.

By aligning triggers, personas, and measurable outcomes, teams transform urgent pain into a structured FixOps rollout—moving from reactive escalations to a durable, audit-ready operating model.

## Feature Validation Snapshot

The automated `test_feature_matrix.py` integration run exercises the full FixOps pipeline with representative design, SBOM, SARIF, and CVE inputs. It confirms the following capabilities execute together without manual intervention:

- **Context & Guardrails** – Context crosswalks, guardrail evaluations, and policy automation workflows all return successful statuses in the same pipeline run.
- **Evidence & Compliance** – Evidence bundles are generated on disk and mapped to compliance scorecards for audit consumption.
- **Analytics & Performance** – ROI analytics, performance profiling, and probabilistic forecasting emit non-empty metrics for leadership reporting.
- **AI, Exploitability, IaC & Tenancy** – AI agent analysis, exploit signal correlation, IaC posture assessment, and tenant lifecycle summaries are produced alongside traditional security modules.

Track this section after each regression cycle to confirm the end-to-end feature surface remains intact as the platform evolves.
