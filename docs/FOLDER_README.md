# docs/

**Purpose:** Architectural and process documentation supporting demo and enterprise enablement.

**Key Files**
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — Component and lifecycle overview with diagrams.
- `DATA_MODEL.md` — Domain model reference.
- `INTEGRATIONS.md` — Third-party dependencies and overlay-managed systems.
- `SDLC_SSDLC.md` — Mapping across development lifecycle stages.
- `CONFIG_GUIDE.md` — Overlay schema and examples.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — Development workflow.

**Gotchas**
- Keep market-facing docs (`market/`) separate; this folder focuses on engineering context.
- Mermaid diagrams render on GitHub; preview with VS Code or `mmdc` if needed.
