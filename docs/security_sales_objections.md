# Addressing Enterprise Security Sales Objections

This guide summarizes common objections raised by financial services institutions (FSIs) when evaluating Fixops' open-source security platform and provides actionable responses to help move deals forward.

## 1. "You do not understand the people and processes in FSIs"

**Why it matters:** Security leadership in FSIs prioritizes governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC). They expect vendors to demonstrate an understanding of regulatory oversight, stakeholder alignment, and change-management practices.

**How to respond:**
- Map Fixops' value to specific FSI personas (CISO, head of security engineering, compliance, audit).
- Share playbooks that show how Fixops integrates into existing SOC processes, including escalation paths and audit-ready reporting.
- Provide case studies or design partners that illustrate successful rollouts with similar governance requirements.

## 2. "Open source is not trusted in the security world"

**Why it matters:** Decision makers worry about supply-chain risk, unmaintained dependencies, and lack of vendor accountability.

**How to respond:**
- Highlight Fixops' secure software development lifecycle (SSDL), including signed releases, SBOM generation, and regular third-party audits.
- Emphasize the transparency benefits of open source (independent code review, faster vulnerability discovery, community hardening).
- Offer enterprise support SLAs, dedicated security response processes, and indemnification options.

## 3. "You do not have a production implementation"

**Why it matters:** Referenceable customers reduce perceived risk and accelerate procurement.

**How to respond:**
- Develop a lighthouse implementation with a design partner and capture measurable outcomes (MTTR reduction, compliance efficiency).
- Package a proof-of-value (PoV) methodology with clear success criteria, timeline, and executive reporting cadence.
- Provide a roadmap for post-PoV hardening, including managed onboarding and ongoing success reviews.

## 4. "How can FSIs trust Fixops?"

**Why it matters:** Trust encompasses technical assurance, operational maturity, and business continuity.

**How to respond:**
- Share security posture artifacts (SOC 2 roadmap, penetration testing results, responsible disclosure policy).
- Document resiliency measures such as disaster recovery runbooks, uptime targets, and dependency management.
- Provide executive briefings that align Fixops' mission with FSI strategic priorities and demonstrate long-term viability.

## Next Steps for Sales Enablement

1. Build a central repository of collateral (personas, PoV plans, compliance mappings) accessible to presales and account teams.
2. Train sales engineers on articulating the open-source value proposition alongside enterprise-grade assurances.
3. Collect feedback from early prospects to refine messaging and address emerging objections quickly.
