- False positives (40%): 400
- Time per false positive: 2 hours
- Security team hourly rate: $100

**Monthly Cost:**
- False positive triage: 400 × 2 hours × $100 = $80,000/month
- Real vulnerability triage: 600 × 4 hours × $100 = $240,000/month
- **Total: $320,000/month**

**With FixOps:**
- False positives (5%): 50
- Time per false positive: 0.5 hours (automated)
- Real vulnerabilities: 950
- Automated triage: 80% reduction
- Manual triage: 190 × 2 hours × $100 = $38,000/month
- False positive triage: 50 × 0.5 hours × $100 = $2,500/month
- **Total: $40,500/month**

**Monthly Savings: $279,500**
**Annual Savings: $3,354,000**

#### 2. MTTR Reduction Savings

**Current State:**
- Average MTTR: 60 days
- Vulnerabilities per month: 1,000
- Average exposure window: 30 days (half of MTTR)
- Cost per day of exposure: $10,000 (breach risk, compliance fines)

**Monthly Cost:**
- Exposure days: 1,000 vulnerabilities × 30 days = 30,000 exposure-days
- Cost: 30,000 × $10,000 = $300,000,000/month

**With FixOps:**
- Average MTTR: 1 day
- Average exposure window: 0.5 days
- Exposure days: 1,000 × 0.5 = 500 exposure-days
- Cost: 500 × $10,000 = $5,000,000/month

**Monthly Savings: $295,000,000**
**Annual Savings: $3,540,000,000**

#### 3. Compliance Automation Savings

**Current State:**
- Compliance reports per month: 10
- Time per report: 8 hours
- Security team hourly rate: $100

**Monthly Cost:**
- 10 reports × 8 hours × $100 = $8,000/month

**With FixOps:**
- Automated reports: 90% reduction
- Time per report: 0.8 hours
- 10 reports × 0.8 hours × $100 = $800/month

**Monthly Savings: $7,200**
**Annual Savings: $86,400**

#### 4. Developer Productivity Savings

**Current State:**
- Developer time per vulnerability fix: 4 hours
- Vulnerabilities per month: 1,000
- Developer hourly rate: $75

**Monthly Cost:**
- 1,000 × 4 hours × $75 = $300,000/month

**With FixOps:**
- Automated remediation: 60% of vulnerabilities
- Manual fixes: 400 × 2 hours × $75 = $60,000/month
- Automated fixes: 600 × 0.5 hours × $75 = $22,500/month
- **Total: $82,500/month**

**Monthly Savings: $217,500**
**Annual Savings: $2,610,000**
