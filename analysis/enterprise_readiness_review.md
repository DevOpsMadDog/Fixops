# Enterprise Readiness Recheck

## Summary
- The FastAPI entrypoint referenced in the README now resolves (`backend.app:create_app`) and proxies to the canonical ingestion surface, enabling the documented `uvicorn backend.app:create_app --factory --reload` command.
- The enterprise overlay executes the full module matrix, including the new enhanced decision module which drives the multi-LLM consensus outputs consumed by the CLI and API.
- `/api/v1/enhanced/*` endpoints expose the consensus engine, providing analysis, model comparisons, signals, and capabilities telemetry guarded by the standard API-key flow.
- The enhanced decision engine fuses severity, guardrails, compliance gaps, CNAPP enrichment, exploitability signals, and AI-agent context to produce deterministic, auditable consensus outputs and SSVC signals.
- Cryptography and structlog dependencies are installed via `requirements.txt`, ensuring evidence encryption paths and the regression suite execute successfully.

## Evidence
- Backend entrypoint bridge: `backend/app.py`
- Enhanced decision engine: `core/enhanced_decision.py`
- Pipeline integration + module status: `apps/api/pipeline.py`
- FastAPI enhanced routes: `apps/api/routes/enhanced.py`
- CLI/API parity tests: `tests/test_enterprise_paths.py`, `tests/test_enhanced_api.py`
- Test suite verification: `pytest -q`
