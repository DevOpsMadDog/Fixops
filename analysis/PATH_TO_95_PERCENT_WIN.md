## RISK MITIGATION (What Could Go Wrong)

### Risk 1: Can't Get Customers
**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: High  
**Mitigation**:
- Offer free POC (no risk to customer)
- Target early adopters (Fortune 500 with pain points)
- Use case studies from pilots to close deals
- Offer 50% discount for early adopters

### Risk 2: Performance Claims Don't Hold Up
**Probability**: Low  
**Impact**: High  
**Mitigation**:
- Run benchmarks on real codebases (not synthetic)
- Publish independent benchmarks
- Get customer validation before making claims
- Be honest about limitations

### Risk 3: Competitors Move Faster
**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Mitigation**:
- Focus on unique differentiators (unified platform, proprietary)
- Move fast on customer acquisition
- Build ecosystem (harder for competitors to replicate)
- Focus on execution, not features

### Risk 4: Market Doesn't Care About Proprietary
**Probability**: Low  
**Impact**: High  
**Mitigation**:
- Prove proprietary > OSS with benchmarks
- Focus on outcomes (95% noise reduction), not technology
- Get customer testimonials on proprietary advantage
- Position as "proven proprietary" not just "proprietary"

---

## FINAL VERDICT: PATH TO 95%

### Current State: **40% Probability**

**Gaps**:
- ❌ 0 customers
- ❌ Unproven performance
- ❌ No market presence
- ❌ Limited language support

### 12-Month Target: **95% Probability**

**Requirements**:
- ✅ 10+ enterprise customers (proven ROI)
- ✅ Proven performance (benchmarks + customer data)
- ✅ Market presence (thought leadership, community)
- ✅ 10+ languages supported
- ✅ SOC 2 Type II certified
- ✅ Thriving ecosystem

### The Path:

**Months 1-3**: Prove it works (benchmarks, pilots) → **55%**  
**Months 4-6**: Get customers (10+ customers) → **75%**  
**Months 7-9**: Build market presence (content, community) → **85%**  
**Months 10-12**: Complete features (languages, SOC 2) → **90%**  
**Months 13-18**: Build ecosystem (partners, integrations) → **95%**

### Bottom Line:

**FixOps can achieve 95% winning probability by executing on 7 critical success factors over 12-18 months.**

**The gap is execution, not technology. FixOps has the technology; now it needs proof, customers, and market presence.**

**Next 3 months are critical**: Must prove performance and get first customers.
