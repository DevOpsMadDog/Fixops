# FixOps: Gartner Magic Quadrant #1 in 24 Hours - Execution Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the aggressive 24-hour execution plan to position FixOps as the #1 leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing (AST) and Software Composition Analysis (SCA).

## Strategic Positioning

### Vision Statement
"FixOps is the only unified, proprietary, enterprise-grade vulnerability management platform that combines design-time, runtime, and reachability analysis with multi-LLM consensus intelligence to deliver 95%+ noise reduction and sub-24-hour MTTR."

### Key Differentiators (vs. Apiiro, Endor Labs, Snyk, Checkmarx)

1. **100% Proprietary Code** - No OSS dependencies in core analysis engines
2. **Unified Design-Time + Runtime** - Single platform, not separate tools
3. **Multi-LLM Consensus** - Proprietary consensus algorithm for decision-making
4. **Enterprise Reachability** - Proprietary call graph and data-flow analysis
5. **Zero-Day Detection** - Proprietary threat intelligence engine
6. **Sub-24-Hour MTTR** - Automated remediation with human-in-the-loop
7. **95%+ Noise Reduction** - Proprietary scoring eliminates false positives
