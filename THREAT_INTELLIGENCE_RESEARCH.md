## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Expansion (High Priority)
1. OSV.dev - Aggregates 40+ ecosystems
2. NVD - Comprehensive CVE database
3. GitHub Security Advisories - Major ecosystem
4. Vendor advisories (Microsoft, Apple, Google, AWS, Azure, GCP)
5. Exploit-DB - Public exploits
6. MITRE ATT&CK - Attack patterns

### Phase 2: Ecosystem Coverage (Medium Priority)
7. Language-specific advisories (npm, PyPI, RubySec, RustSec, Go, Maven, NuGet)
8. Linux distribution advisories (Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, Alpine)
9. Container security (Snyk, Trivy, Anchore)
10. Cloud security (AWS GuardDuty, Azure Security Center, GCP SCC)

### Phase 3: Threat Intelligence (Medium Priority)
11. Threat feeds (AlienVault OTX, Abuse.ch, VirusTotal)
12. Exploit intelligence (Metasploit, Rapid7 AttackerKB)
13. IOC feeds (URLhaus, MalwareBazaar, ThreatFox)

### Phase 4: Specialized Sources (Lower Priority)
14. Industry-specific (ICS-CERT, Medical, Automotive, IoT)
15. Research sources (arXiv, IEEE, ACM, conferences)
16. Threat actor intelligence (MISP, APT groups, ransomware)

## Architecture Recommendations

### 1. Extensible Feed Framework
- Plugin-based architecture for easy addition of new sources
- Standardized feed interface (fetch, parse, normalize)
- Configurable update intervals per source
- Error handling and retry logic
- Rate limiting and API quota management

### 2. Data Normalization
- Unified vulnerability schema (extend existing NormalizedCVEFeed)
- Source attribution and confidence scoring
- Deduplication across sources
- Enrichment pipeline (add context from multiple sources)

### 3. Storage Strategy
- **File Storage**: Raw feed data for audit/compliance
- **VectorDB**: Semantic search across vulnerabilities and patterns
- **Queryable DB**: Portfolio search, inventory, filtering
- **Cache Layer**: Frequently accessed data

### 4. Query Capabilities
- Portfolio search by: SBOM, CVE, APP, org_id, component, vendor, product
- Cross-reference queries (CVE → exploits → threat actors)
- Temporal queries (vulnerabilities over time)
- Severity/risk filtering
- Compliance mapping

## Next Steps

1. Implement extensible feed framework
2. Add Phase 1 sources (OSV, NVD, GHSA, major vendors)
3. Implement hybrid storage (VectorDB + queryable DB)
4. Add portfolio search capabilities
5. Implement Phase 2-4 sources incrementally
6. Create comprehensive tests
7. Update documentation
