## 🎭 Were There Any Debates?

Yes, but **NOT about accepting the changes**. All debates were about FUTURE improvements:

### Topics Debated (for future work):
1. **Status Management Approach** - Locks vs State Machine vs Events
   - **Consensus:** Current fix is good, improve later

2. **SARIF Utilities** - Shared vs Per-Agent
   - **Consensus:** Current is fine, consider shared utility later

3. **Strategy Pattern** - Now vs Later
   - **Consensus:** Current works, refactor when time permits

**Bottom line:** All models agreed to accept current changes and discuss architecture improvements in future PRs.
