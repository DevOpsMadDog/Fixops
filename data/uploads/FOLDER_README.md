# data/uploads/

**Purpose:** Scratch space for manual file uploads during demos. Empty by default.

**Usage**
- Place temporary CSV, SBOM, SARIF, or CVE files here if you want reproducible uploads without touching
  fixtures.
- Overlay directories may be created alongside this folder; treat all contents as ephemeral.

**Gotchas**
- Do not commit personal or proprietary data. Add a `.gitignore` entry if storing generated files
  locally.
