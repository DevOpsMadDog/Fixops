# Enterprise Demo Hardening PR Summary

## Security & Configuration
- Tightened CORS enforcement, token validation, and session isolation inside the FastAPI ingestion service to prevent cross-tenant data bleed and credential bypasses.  Key changes include the `SessionRegistry`, run-id validation, and restrictive overlay-driven CORS defaults in `backend/app.py`.
- Overlay loader now validates mode overrides and enforces deterministic directories, demo token guards, and allow-listed data roots.  See `fixops/configuration.py` for explicit schema checks and sandbox token injection controls.
- Docker Compose and production Docker images source secrets from `.env` templates, keep authentication enabled, and honour configurable worker counts via `FIXOPS_UVICORN_WORKERS`.  Adjustments span `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, and `supervisord.conf`.

## Pipeline & CLI Enhancements
- Added the `fixops.demo_runner` module with curated SBOM/SARIF/CVE fixtures plus CLI wiring so `python -m fixops.cli demo` can execute demo or enterprise overlays end-to-end.  Artefacts are archived deterministically under overlay-allowlisted directories.
- Hardened exploit refresh scheduling and analytics storage with bounded retries, timeout-aware fetches, and deterministic credential generation to avoid long-blocking requests or secret leakage.

## Infrastructure & Testing
- Kubernetes manifests gained resource requests/limits, PodDisruptionBudget, and HorizontalPodAutoscaler definitions while Terraform references were normalised for environment-specific state.  Secrets now reference templated values instead of placeholders.
- Introduced GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to run lint/tests, build/push Docker images, and apply Kubernetes manifests after successful checks.
- Expanded regression coverage with `tests/test_backend_security.py`, `tests/test_demo_runner.py`, and overlay configuration tests to ensure authentication, demo flows, and overlay merges remain enforced.

## Usage & Documentation
- README quick start highlights copying `.env.example`, running the CLI demo in demo/enterprise modes, and inspecting overlay outputs.
- Added `reviews/` artefacts capturing RepoMap, module summaries, consolidated findings, and this PR summary for future reviewers.
