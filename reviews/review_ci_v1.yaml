ReviewReport_v1:
  category: ci_cd
  global_findings:
    - severity: high
      aspect: pipeline_coverage
      description: "Repository lacks `.github/workflows` or other CI manifests, so tests, lint, and security scans are not enforced before merges." 
      evidence:
        - "983253†L1-L2"
      recommendation: "Add branch-protected workflows covering lint (ruff/mypy), tests with coverage, secret scan, and artefact build/publish gates."
    - severity: medium
      aspect: reproducibility
      description: "Docker/Kubernetes configs rely on `:latest` tags and absence of lockfiles, breaking deterministic deployments." 
      evidence:
        - "F:fixops-blended-enterprise/kubernetes/backend-deployment.yaml†L27-L32"
        - "F:backend/requirements.txt†L1-L7"
      recommendation: "Publish versioned images, pin dependencies via lockfiles, and surface SBOM/signature generation in CI."
    - severity: medium
      aspect: secret_scanning
      description: "Static manifests ship base64 placeholder secrets without automated rotation or leak detection." 
      evidence:
        - "F:fixops-blended-enterprise/kubernetes/secret.yaml†L7-L18"
      recommendation: "Introduce secret-scanning and enforce external secret managers; ensure CI fails when placeholder values persist."
    - severity: low
      aspect: release_promotion
      description: "No documented staging → production promotion flow; Terraform backend uses a shared bucket without environment partitioning." 
      evidence:
        - "F:fixops-blended-enterprise/terraform/main.tf†L17-L53"
      recommendation: "Document and automate environment-specific promotion with isolated state backends and release branches."
