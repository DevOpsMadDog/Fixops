  category: testing
  observations:
    - strength: "Comprehensive end-to-end test exercises FastAPI ingestion, pipeline orchestration, analytics, and evidence bundling." 
      evidence:
        - "F:tests/test_end_to_end.py†L29-L200"
    - gap:
        severity: high
        area: security_regression
        description: "No tests assert CORS/token enforcement paths—e.g., missing/invalid API keys or cross-origin rejection." 
        evidence:
          - "F:apps/api/app.py†L47-L58"
          - "F:tests/test_end_to_end.py†L93-L154"
        recommendation: "Add tests that attempt requests without `X-API-Key` and verify 401/403, plus coverage for CORS headers."
    - gap:
        severity: medium
        area: concurrency
        description: "Test suite runs pipeline sequentially; there are no concurrent upload/run scenarios to surface shared `app.state.artifacts` issues." 
        evidence:
          - "F:apps/api/app.py†L80-L165"
          - "F:tests/test_end_to_end.py†L93-L154"
        recommendation: "Introduce tests spawning multiple TestClient tasks to detect artefact overwrites or require session IDs."
    - gap:
        severity: medium
        area: infra_validation
        description: "Terraform/Kubernetes manifests lack smoke tests or linters validating schema, RBAC, and image tags." 
        evidence:
          - "F:enterprise/kubernetes/backend-deployment.yaml†L1-L101"
          - "F:enterprise/terraform/main.tf†L4-L90"
        recommendation: "Add terratest/conftest or kubeval checks in CI to prevent invalid manifests from shipping."
