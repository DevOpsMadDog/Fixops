# FixOps Positioning Narrative

## Who
High-growth software organizations (Series C to post-IPO) with complex hybrid cloud estates and regulated obligations. Primary buyers: CISOs and AppSec leaders; champions: DevSecOps and platform teams.

## Problem
Existing security posture tools either drown teams in undifferentiated alerts or require months of graph modeling and services before value. Teams cannot connect risk prioritization to business impact or produce audit-ready evidence without manual toil.

## Category
