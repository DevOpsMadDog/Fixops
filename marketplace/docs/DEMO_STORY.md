# FixOps Demo Storyboard

## Audience
AppSec lead, DevSecOps engineer, and platform partner evaluating FixOps for contextual risk management.

## Narrative Arc
1. **Hook:** Show 5,000 raw findings landing daily; teams cannot keep pace.
2. **Introduce FixOps:** Launch demo workspace with pre-configured integrations via overlay wizard.
3. **Context Fusion:** Display how FixOps ingests GitHub, IaC, and cloud misconfigurations, tagging each with service owner, data classification, and runtime criticality.
4. **Adaptive Guardrail:** Demonstrate CI pipeline run where FixOps downgrades a low-impact CVE, allowing deployment while flagging a high-impact misconfiguration for mandatory fix.
5. **Evidence Automation:** Generate SOC 2 Bundle showing remediation tasks, approvals, and residual risk acceptance.
6. **Executive Dashboard:** Showcase ROI analytics tracking noise reduction and MTTR improvements.
7. **Call to Action:** Invite stakeholders to configure their own overlay for a 14-day POV.

## Key Screens & Moments
1. **Overlay Wizard:** Stepper UI for selecting Demo vs Enterprise, connecting Jira/Git, enabling default policy packs.
2. **Context Fusion Canvas:** Graphical view of finding correlated with asset metadata, owner, and SLA.
3. **Triage Workbench:** Prioritized queue with auto-suggested remediation paths and waiver actions.
4. **CI/CD Policy Report:** Build log snippet showing adaptive gate decision with rationale.
