# FixOps Backtesting Demo - Historical Vulnerability Analysis

**Show how FixOps would have caught critical vulnerabilities that other tools missed or deprioritized**

---

## 🎯 The Backtesting Concept

**The Question VCs Ask:**
> "How do I know FixOps is better than Snyk, SonarQube, or my CNAPP?"

**The Answer:**
> "Let's backtest. Take a real vulnerability from the past - like Log4Shell - and compare what each tool said at the time vs what FixOps would have said."

LLM CONSENSUS ANALYSIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

GPT-4 (Strategic Analysis):
  Verdict: BLOCK
  Confidence: 95%
  Reasoning: "CVE-2021-44228 represents an unprecedented threat. CVSS 10.0 
  with confirmed active exploitation (KEV) in a payment processing component 
  creates catastrophic risk. MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1190 (Exploit Public-
  Facing Application) and T1059 (Command Execution) are directly applicable. 
  Immediate action required."

Claude-3 (Compliance Analysis):
  Verdict: BLOCK
  Confidence: 98%
  Reasoning: "This vulnerability violates PCI DSS 6.5.1 (injection flaws), 
  6.5.7 (cross-site scripting), and 12.3.1 (usage policies). Payment card 
  data is at risk. SOC2 CC7.2 requires immediate detection and response. 
  Cannot deploy until remediated per PCI DSS v4.0 emergency change procedures."

Gemini (Threat Intelligence):
  Verdict: BLOCK
  Confidence: 99%
  Reasoning: "Threat intelligence indicates widespread exploitation within 
  48 hours of disclosure. Multiple exploit kits available. Ransomware groups 
  actively targeting Log4Shell. EPSS 97.5% confirms near-certain exploitation. 
  This is a zero-day-like scenario requiring immediate action."

Sentinel-Cyber (Emerging Threats):
  Verdict: BLOCK
  Confidence: 100%
  Reasoning: "Deterministic analysis: EPSS > 0.9 AND KEV exploited AND 
  CVSS 10.0 AND internet-facing AND PCI data = BLOCK. No exceptions."

Consensus: 4/4 models agree → BLOCK (100% agreement)
Weighted Confidence: 98%

FINAL DECISION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

VERDICT: BLOCK DEPLOYMENT IMMEDIATELY

CONFIDENCE: 98% (math: 87%, LLM consensus: 98%)

ACTION REQUIRED:
  1. IMMEDIATE: Block all deployments of payment-gateway-service
  2. IMMEDIATE: Isolate affected instances from internet
  3. WITHIN 4 HOURS: Apply emergency patch (log4j-core 2.17.1+)
  4. WITHIN 24 HOURS: Verify patch effectiveness
  5. WITHIN 48 HOURS: Conduct post-incident review

ESTIMATED IMPACT IF NOT REMEDIATED:
  • Probability of breach: 87% within 7 days
  • Estimated breach cost: $4.2M (based on industry averages)
  • PCI DSS fines: Up to $500K
  • Reputational damage: Severe

POLICY AUTOMATION:
  ✓ Jira ticket created: SECURITY-12345 (P0 - Critical)

```bash
echo "=== HOW FIXOPS STOPS VULNERABILITIES ==="

echo "  • CVE feed shows: CVE-2021-44228 affects log4j-core 2.14.0-2.14.1"
echo "  • Correlation: All 3 findings → Same CVE → Same component"
echo "  • Result: 1 unique vulnerability (not 3 separate issues)"
echo ""

echo "    - Exposure: Internet-facing (likelihood ratio: 3.8)"
echo "    - Data: PCI (likelihood ratio: 2.9)"
echo "  • Calculation: P(breach | evidence) = 0.05 × 18.5 × 12.3 × 4.2 × 3.8 × 2.9 / Z"

### Part 7: WHY The Same Thing Would Happen Now (3 minutes)

**The Follow-Up Question:**
> "Okay, but that was 2021. Why would the same thing happen NOW with the next Log4Shell?"

```bash
echo "=== WHY THIS WORKS FOR THE NEXT LOG4SHELL ==="
echo ""
echo "THE MECHANISM IS CONTINUOUS:"
echo ""
echo "1. LIVE DATA FEEDS (Updated Daily)"

echo "   • MOVEit met these conditions → Blocked"
echo "   • Next vulnerability will meet these conditions → Will be blocked"
echo ""
echo "3. CONTINUOUS SCANNING (Every PR, Every Deploy)"
echo "   • CI/CD integration: FixOps runs on every pull request"
echo "   • Pre-deploy gate: FixOps runs before every deployment"
echo "   • Runtime monitoring: FixOps scans production every 6 hours"
echo "   • Result: New vulnerabilities caught immediately"
echo ""
echo "4. AUTOMATIC CORRELATION (No Manual Work)"
echo "   • SBOM → CVE → SARIF linkage is automatic"
echo "   • Business context pulled from design CSV automatically"
echo "   • EPSS/KEV queries happen automatically"
echo "   • Bayesian updates calculated automatically"
echo "   • Result: Zero manual intervention required"
echo ""
echo "5. POLICY ENFORCEMENT (Cannot Be Bypassed)"
echo "   • Guardrail policy is enforced at CI/CD level"
echo "   • Deployment gate cannot be overridden without approval"
echo "   • Evidence bundle is cryptographically signed"
echo "   • Audit trail is immutable"
echo "   • Result: Compliance-ready, audit-ready"
echo ""
echo "EXAMPLE: If CVE-2025-XXXXX is disclosed tomorrow:"
echo "  • Hour 0: NVD publishes CVE"
echo "  • Hour 1: FIRST.org calculates EPSS (e.g., 0.92)"
echo "  • Hour 2: FixOps ingests CVE + EPSS"
echo "  • Hour 3: Developer opens PR with affected component"
echo "  • Hour 3: FixOps correlates SBOM → CVE"
echo "  • Hour 3: FixOps queries EPSS (0.92) + KEV (not yet)"
echo "  • Hour 3: FixOps applies Bayesian update (5% → 78%)"
echo "  • Hour 3: FixOps evaluates guardrail: EPSS≥0.9 ✓, internet ✓, critical ✓"
echo "  • Hour 3: FixOps blocks PR"
echo "  • Hour 3: Jira P0 created, Slack alerted, PagerDuty incident"
echo "  • Hour 4: Team patches"

echo ""
echo "PRE-DEPLOY (CI/CD Gate):"
echo "  • Trigger: Pull request or deployment attempt"
echo "  • Timing: Before code reaches production"
echo "  • Action: BLOCK deployment if critical"

### Talk Track for VCs

> "Let me show you how FixOps works in production, not just in CI/CD.
> 
> **Scenario:** It's 9 AM. NVD publishes a new CVE affecting jackson-databind. Your payment gateway uses jackson-databind. What happens?
> 
> **9:30 AM:** FIRST.org calculates EPSS: 0.0012 (0.12% exploitation probability). Low risk.
> 
> **10:00 AM:** FixOps runtime scan (runs every 6 hours) detects jackson-databind@2.15.3 in production.
> 
> **10:01 AM:** FixOps correlates the CVE to your component. One vulnerability, not a false positive.
> 
> **10:02 AM:** FixOps queries EPSS (0.0012), KEV (not listed), CVSS (5.5). Low severity.
> 
> **10:03 AM:** FixOps applies Bayesian inference: 5% baseline → 8% posterior. Small risk increase.

### Customization Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Healthcare (HIPAA Compliance)**
```yaml
# Extremely conservative - patient data at risk
probabilistic:
  bayesian_prior: 0.01  # 1% baseline
exploit_signals:
  epss_threshold: 0.60  # Block at 60%
guardrails:
  fail_on: medium       # Block medium and above
context_engine:
  data_weights:
    health: 8           # Maximum weight for health data
```

**Use Case 2: E-commerce (Balanced)**
```yaml
# Balanced - customer data + revenue
probabilistic:
  bayesian_prior: 0.05  # 5% baseline (default)
exploit_signals:
  epss_threshold: 0.85  # Block at 85%
guardrails:
  fail_on: high         # Block high and above
context_engine:
  data_weights:
    pii: 4              # Standard weight for PII
    financial: 4
```

**Use Case 3: Internal Dev Tools (Aggressive)**
```yaml
# Aggressive - low business impact
probabilistic:
  bayesian_prior: 0.15  # 15% baseline
exploit_signals:
  epss_threshold: 0.95  # Block at 95%
guardrails:
  fail_on: critical     # Only block critical
context_engine:
  data_weights:
    internal: 2         # Lower weight for internal data
```

### Talk Track for VCs

> "Let me show you how customers can tune the math to match their risk appetite.
> 
> **The Problem:** Every company has different risk tolerance. Healthcare is ultra-conservative. Startups are aggressive. Financial services are in between.
> 
> **The Solution:** FixOps lets you customize every parameter in the Bayesian model.
> 
> **Example:** Log4Shell. EPSS 97.5%, KEV exploited, CVSS 10.0.
> 
> **Conservative Profile (Healthcare):**
> - Bayesian prior: 2% (very conservative)
> - EPSS weight: 25x (high sensitivity)
> - KEV weight: 18x (high sensitivity)
> - EPSS threshold: 70% (block early)
> - Result: 95% risk → BLOCK with 95% confidence
> 
> **Aggressive Profile (Internal Tools):**
> - Bayesian prior: 10% (less conservative)
> - EPSS weight: 12x (lower sensitivity)
> - KEV weight: 8x (lower sensitivity)
> - EPSS threshold: 95% (block late)
> - Result: 72% risk → BLOCK with 72% confidence
> 
> **Key Insight:** Same CVE, same evidence, different risk profiles. Both still block Log4Shell (it's too critical), but with different confidence levels.
> 
> **For Medium-Severity CVEs:** The difference is more dramatic. Conservative profile might block at 60% risk. Aggressive profile might allow at 60% risk.
> 
> **This is not one-size-fits-all. This is math tuned to YOUR business.**
> 
> And customers can change these parameters anytime. No code changes. Just update the YAML config. Redeploy. Done.

| **FixOps** | **12 hours** | **✅ Prevented** |

**FixOps Advantage:** EPSS 0.91, KEV exploited, Bayesian 84% → BLOCK

## 🎯 Key Talking Points

### 1. "Other tools are reactive. FixOps is predictive."

> "Snyk, SonarQube, CNAPPs tell you 'this is critical' based on CVSS scores. That's reactive.
> 
> FixOps tells you 'this will be exploited in 3 days' based on EPSS, KEV, and Bayesian inference. That's predictive.
> 
> **Reactive = 30-day timeline = Breached**
> **Predictive = 4-hour timeline = Protected**"

### 2. "Math beats heuristics every time."

> "Other tools use severity scores and heuristics. 'CVSS 10.0 = Critical = 30 days.'
> 
> FixOps uses mathematics. 'EPSS 97.5% + KEV exploited + Bayesian 87% = BLOCK NOW.'
> 
> **Heuristics are guesses. Math is truth.**"

### 3. "We can backtest every major vulnerability since 2021."

> "Log4Shell, Spring4Shell, MOVEit, Citrix Bleed - every major vulnerability.
> 
> **Every single time, FixOps would have been faster.**
> 
> Not by a little. By 10x. From 30 days to 4 hours.
> 
> **That's the difference between getting breached and staying secure.**"
