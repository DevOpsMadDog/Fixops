# FixOps Deprecations

The `WIP/` tree tracks legacy enterprise experiments and should not be treated as
canonical documentation or code. Use the root-level `docs/` directory and
`readme_updated.md` for the architecture and developer guides.

Legacy enterprise deployment docs and scaffolding will be retired in favour of the
streamlined services layout. Contributions should avoid referencing `WIP/code/` paths
unless specifically working on archival clean-up tasks.
