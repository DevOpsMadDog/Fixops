## Compound Tasks

> **Note**: By default, hydra-scout is pre-dispatched in parallel with task classification for

> task decompositions below show the explicit Wave 1 scout dispatch for clarity, but in practice,
> scout may already be returning results by the time Wave 1 launches.

Many real user requests contain multiple subtasks at different tiers. Decompose them:

### Example 1: "Fix the bug in auth.py and add tests"
1. **hydra-scout (Haiku 4.5)** [BLOCKING] → Find auth.py, read it, understand the context
2. **hydra-analyst (Sonnet 4.6)** [BLOCKING] → Diagnose the root cause (skip for obvious errors)
3. **hydra-coder (Sonnet 4.6)** [BLOCKING] → Fix the bug and write tests
4. **hydra-sentinel-scan (Haiku 4.5)** [BLOCKING] → Integration sweep on changed files
   **hydra-guard (Haiku 4.5)** [BLOCKING] → Security scan on changed files
   **hydra-runner (Haiku 4.5)** [BLOCKING] → Run the tests to verify
5. *(If sentinel-scan flags issues)* **hydra-sentinel (Sonnet 4.6)** [BLOCKING] → Deep analysis

**With the codebase map**: step 1 starts with a map lookup — if auth.py shows
risk=critical with 12 dependents, sentinel-scan checks all 12 dependents from the
map's blast radius (no codebase-wide grep), and deep sentinel analysis is
auto-escalated because of the critical risk score.

**The anti-pattern**: reading auth.py yourself, fixing it yourself, and running
the tests yourself — the orchestrator burns frontier-tier tokens on work the
cheap and mid tiers handle at a fraction of the cost.

### Example 2: "Refactor the API module and update the docs"
1. **hydra-scout (Haiku 4.5)** [BLOCKING] → Map the current API module structure
2. **hydra-coder (Sonnet 4.6)** [BLOCKING] → Perform the refactoring
3. **hydra-sentinel-scan (Haiku 4.5)** [BLOCKING] → Integration sweep on refactored code
   **hydra-guard (Haiku 4.5)** [BLOCKING] → Security scan on changed files
   **hydra-runner (Haiku 4.5)** [BLOCKING] → Run tests to verify nothing broke
   **hydra-scribe (Haiku 4.5)** [NON-BLOCKING] → Update documentation (fire & forget)
4. *(If sentinel-scan flags issues)* **hydra-sentinel (Sonnet 4.6)** [BLOCKING] → Deep analysis

### Example 3: "Review the codebase and suggest architecture improvements"
1. **hydra-scout (Haiku 4.5)** → Map the project structure and key files
2. **hydra-analyst (Sonnet 4.6)** → Review code quality and patterns
3. **Orchestrator (you)** → Synthesize findings into architecture recommendations

### Example 4: "Set up CI/CD for this project"
1. **hydra-scout (Haiku 4.5)** → Understand the project structure, build system, test framework
2. **Orchestrator (you)** → Design the CI/CD pipeline (architectural decision)
3. **hydra-coder (Sonnet 4.6)** → Implement the config files
4. **hydra-runner (Haiku 4.5)** → Validate the configuration

### Example 5: "This function is slow, figure out why"
1. **hydra-analyst (Sonnet 4.6)** → Profile and diagnose the performance issue
2. **Orchestrator (you)** → Decide the optimization approach (architectural judgment)
3. **hydra-coder (Sonnet 4.6)** → Implement the optimization
4. **hydra-runner (Haiku 4.5)** → Benchmark before and after

### Example 6: "Redesign the auth module to use OAuth2"
1. **hydra-scout** → map current auth module structure [parallel with Step 2]
2. **hydra-scout** → research OAuth2 patterns in codebase [parallel with Step 1]
3. **Orchestrator (you)** → design the new architecture (this is YOUR job)
4. **hydra-coder #1** → implement OAuth2 provider [parallel with Steps 5-6]
5. **hydra-coder #2** → implement token management [parallel with Steps 4, 6]
6. **hydra-coder #3** → update route handlers [parallel with Steps 4-5]
7. **hydra-sentinel-scan** → integration sweep on all changes
8. **hydra-runner** → run full test suite

**With the codebase map**: if the map shows the module (e.g. src/db/connection.ts
in a comparable refactor) at risk=critical with 15 dependents, plan the parallel
coder dispatches around the full blast radius and treat sentinel deep analysis
as required, not optional.

### Example 7: "Quick — add a console.log to line 5"
**Handle it yourself.** A trivial one-shot edit is faster done directly than
dispatched — this is the standing exception, not a violation.

### Low-risk shortcut: "Add a new utility function"
1. Check map: new file, risk=low (zero dependents initially)
2. **hydra-coder** → write the function
3. **hydra-sentinel-scan** → low risk, quick scan, auto-accept if clean
   (without the map, the same expensive scan as a critical file)

## Common Misclassifications

These are tasks that look like one tier but are actually another:

| Task | Looks like | Actually | Why |
|------|-----------|----------|-----|
| "Add a simple button" | Haiku (simple) | hydra-coder (Sonnet) | Needs to match existing component patterns |
| "Read the logs and find the error" | Haiku (read) | hydra-analyst (Sonnet) | Log analysis requires reasoning |
| "Fix the typo in line 42" | hydra-coder (Sonnet) | hydra-scribe (Haiku) | Trivial mechanical change |
| "Add caching" | hydra-coder (Sonnet) | Orchestrator (handle yourself) | Cache invalidation strategy is hard |
| "Write a migration to add a column" | hydra-coder (Sonnet) | hydra-scribe (Haiku) | Template-level SQL |
| "Upgrade React from 17 to 18" | Haiku (simple) | Orchestrator (handle yourself) | Breaking changes need careful analysis |

## Quick Decision Flowchart

```
Task arrives
│
├── In a Delegate table? ── YES ──→ Route to specified agent
│
├── In the Handle Yourself table? ── YES ──→ Orchestrator handles directly
│
└── Neither? → JUDGMENT CALLS:
    ├── Requires conversation context? ── YES ──→ Orchestrator
    ├── Cheap/mid tier can do equally well? ── NO ──→ Orchestrator
    └── Delegation takes LONGER? ── YES (and truly trivial) ──→ Orchestrator
        └── Otherwise ──→ Delegate to best-fit agent
```

## Sentinel Routing

Sentinel is NOT manually routed. It triggers AUTOMATICALLY after code changes:

| Event | Triggers |
|-------|----------|
| hydra-coder writes/edits code | → sentinel-scan (always) |
| hydra-analyst suggests code changes | → sentinel-scan (always) |
| Orchestrator makes direct code changes | → sentinel-scan (always) |
| sentinel-scan finds issues | → sentinel deep analysis |
| sentinel-scan is clean | → nothing (done) |
| hydra-scribe writes docs | → nothing (skip) |
| hydra-git commits | → nothing (skip) |
| hydra-runner runs tests | → nothing (skip) |
