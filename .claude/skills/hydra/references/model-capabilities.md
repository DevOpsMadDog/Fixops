# Model Capabilities Reference

Understanding what each model does well (and where it struggles) is key to effective routing.
This reference helps calibrate delegation decisions.

## Claude Haiku 4.5

### Strengths
- Extremely fast response times (~10× faster than Opus)
- Very low cost per token (~5× cheaper than Opus)
- Excellent at following clear, well-defined instructions
- Strong at text extraction, search, and pattern matching
- Good at generating code from templates and clear patterns
- Reliable for mechanical tasks with unambiguous specifications
- Great at summarization and information retrieval

### Limitations
- Weaker at multi-step reasoning chains
- Can miss subtle bugs or edge cases in code review
- Less reliable with complex architectural decisions
- May produce simpler solutions when a nuanced approach is needed
- Can struggle with ambiguous or underspecified requirements
- Less creative in problem-solving approaches

### Ideal Task Profile
Short context, clear instructions, well-defined output, no judgment calls needed.

### Auto-Accept Thresholds
Haiku outputs qualify for auto-accept when they are raw, factual, and unambiguous:
- **hydra-scout**: File paths, grep results, directory listings, code snippets with location markers
- **hydra-runner**: All-pass results, clean build/lint output, git status output
- **hydra-scribe**: Internal docstrings, inline comments, changelog entries
- **Requires verify**: Any analysis, interpretation, or user-facing documentation

### hydra-scout (Haiku 4.5)
- **Strengths**: Codebase exploration, file search, reading, and codebase
  map building/maintenance — builds and incrementally updates the dependency
  map using grep-based import extraction, no external parsers required
- **Memory focus**: Codebase structure, key file locations, module boundaries,
  map build history, files that failed to parse

### hydra-sentinel-scan (Haiku 4.5)
- **Strengths**: Pattern matching, grep-level analysis, import tracing,
  fast structural checks, and map-based instant blast-radius lookups
  (reads the codebase map for dependency lookups; falls back to grep
  if the map doesn't exist)
- **Map-aware checks**: Risk-based severity, test coverage warnings,
  env var index lookups, blast radius reporting
- **Limitations**: Cannot understand semantic meaning of data shapes,
  may produce false positives on complex contract changes
- **Memory focus**: Codebase dependency graph, coupling patterns,
  false positive history

## Claude Sonnet 4.6

### Strengths
- Strong code generation across most languages and frameworks
- Good reasoning about code structure and patterns
- Reliable bug fixing when errors are identifiable
- Effective code review for common issues
- Good at test writing with understanding of business logic
- Handles refactoring with awareness of dependencies
- Balances speed and capability well

### Limitations
- May not catch the most subtle architectural issues
- Less reliable than Opus for novel algorithm design
- Can sometimes miss non-obvious security implications
- May not fully optimize complex performance bottlenecks
- Less effective at synthesizing large amounts of disparate information

### Ideal Task Profile
Standard software engineering tasks: implementation, testing, debugging, review. Tasks where
the approach is established even if the specific implementation requires thought.

### Auto-Accept Thresholds
Sonnet outputs always require orchestrator review — code changes and analysis are never auto-accepted:
- **hydra-coder**: ALWAYS verify — scan for correctness, edge cases, project pattern alignment
- **hydra-analyst**: ALWAYS verify — validate reasoning, check suggested fix against actual code

### hydra-sentinel (Sonnet 4.6)
- **Strengths**: Semantic understanding of data flow, contract validation
  across component boundaries, accurate false positive filtering,
  specific fix suggestions
- **Limitations**: Slower and more expensive — only triggered when needed
- **Memory focus**: API patterns, architectural boundaries, historical
  breakage patterns, component communication flows

## Claude Opus 4.6

### Strengths
- Deepest reasoning and analysis capability
- Best at novel problem-solving and architecture design
- Most reliable for subtle bug detection
- Strongest at synthesizing complex, multi-source information
- Best judgment on ambiguous tradeoffs
- Most creative in approach selection
- Highest accuracy on edge cases

### Limitations
- Slowest response time
- Highest cost per token
- Overkill for routine tasks (same quality as Sonnet on standard work)

### Ideal Task Profile
Hard problems: architecture design, subtle debugging, complex tradeoffs, novel implementations,
security analysis, anything where getting it wrong is costly.

### Auto-Accept Thresholds
N/A — Opus is the orchestrator, not a delegated head. Opus output goes directly to the user.

## Cost

Real per-model prices live in the PRICING map inside the installed
`hydra-token-math.js` hook — the single source of pricing truth. Run
`/hydra:stats` for actual session costs and savings.

The key insight: for 60-70% of coding tasks, the cheap and mid tiers produce
output identical in quality to what the orchestrator would produce, but
dramatically faster and cheaper. The skill is in identifying the 30-40% where
the orchestrator is genuinely needed.

## Acceptance Rate Expectations

Drawing from speculative decoding theory, track these metrics mentally:

| Draft Model | Expected Acceptance Rate | Notes |
|-------------|------------------------|-------|
| Haiku → Opus verification | ~85-90% | For well-classified cheap-tier tasks |
| Sonnet → Opus verification | ~90-95% | For well-classified mid-tier tasks |
| sentinel-scan → sentinel escalation | ~20% | ~80%+ of scans return clean — only ~20% escalate to deep analysis |
| sentinel → Opus verification | ~95% | Sonnet's deep analysis is highly accurate; Opus rarely overrides |

If your acceptance rate drops below 80%, you're likely misclassifying tasks — shift borderline
tasks to a higher tier. If it's consistently above 95%, you might be too conservative.

The analogy to speculative decoding is direct: just as the paper found acceptance rates of
~0.7-0.9 for draft tokens depending on domain, our task-level acceptance rates should be
similar or better, since we have more context for classification than a draft model has for
next-token prediction.
