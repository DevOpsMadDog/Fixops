# FixOps Executive Summary for CISOs

**The Intelligent Decision Layer for Security Scanners**

---

## The Problem: Scanner Noise is Drowning Your Security Team

**Your Current Reality:**

You've invested in best-in-class security scanners (Snyk, Trivy, Semgrep, Checkmarx). They work perfectly - they find **everything**. But that's the problem.

**Real Example from December 2021 (Log4Shell Incident):**
- **45 CVE alerts** from your scanners
- **8 marked "CRITICAL"** (CVSS >= 9.0)
- **All treated equally** by CVSS-only policies
- **1 actually exploited in the wild** (Log4Shell)
- **7 false positives** (internal services, dev/test environments)

**Your team's response:**
- Block all 8 CVEs (standard "block CVSS >= 9.0" policy)
- Development teams frustrated (7 false blocks)
- Exception requests flood in
- Security team approves exceptions (they seem reasonable)
- **Log4Shell exception approved** (payment gateway deemed "low-risk")
- **Breach occurs on day 28**

**This is the "boy who cried wolf" problem.** When 87.5% of your critical alerts are false positives, teams stop trusting the policy.

## The FixOps Solution: Math + Context + Intelligence

FixOps doesn't replace your scanners. We sit **ON TOP** of them and make them intelligent.

### How It Works (3 Steps)

**Step 1: Exploit Intelligence**
- Query CISA KEV (1,422 known exploited CVEs)
- Query FIRST.org EPSS (exploitation probability)
- Identify which CVEs are **actually** being exploited

**Step 2: Business Context**
- Internet-facing vs internal
- Production vs dev/test
- PCI/PII data vs internal metrics
- Critical services vs support tools

**Step 3: Risk Calculation**
- Bayesian inference: 5% → 87% risk increase
- Markov forecasting: 7-day, 30-day projections
- Multi-LLM consensus: 88.2% confidence
- Cryptographically signed evidence

## ROI Calculator

### Time Savings

**Manual Triage:**
- 45 CVE alerts × 15 minutes each = 11.25 hours per release
- 52 releases per year = 585 hours per year
- 3-person security team = **195 hours saved per person per year**

**Cost Savings:**
- 585 hours × $100/hour = **$58,500 per year**
- Or: 585 hours × $150/hour = **$87,750 per year** (senior engineer rate)

### Breach Prevention

**Average Data Breach Cost (IBM 2024):**
- Average: $4.88 million
- Healthcare: $10.93 million
- Financial: $6.08 million

**FixOps ROI:**
- Cost: $50,000/year (estimated)
- Savings: $58,500 (time) + $4,880,000 (one breach prevented)
- **ROI: 9,869%**

### Developer Velocity

**Deployment Delays:**
- CVSS-only: 8 blocked deployments per release
- FixOps: 1 blocked deployment per release
- **7 fewer delays** = faster time to market

**Developer Satisfaction:**
- No false positive blocks = happier developers
- Trusted security policies = better compliance
- Faster feedback loops = improved security culture
