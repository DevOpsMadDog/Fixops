# Optional tooling -----------------------------------------------------------
#
# ``snyk-to-sarif`` is only required when converting Snyk scan output to SARIF
# and currently ships exclusively from a private Git repository.  Pinned
# requirements that pull from private remotes cause ``pip`` installs inside
# sandboxed environments (including our CI and pre-commit checks) to fail with
# an interactive credential prompt.  To keep the default installation path
# reproducible we track the dependency separately.  Developers that have access
# to the Snyk repository can install it manually via::
#
#     pip install -r apps/api/requirements-optional.txt
#
# or directly::
#
#     pip install git+https://github.com/snyk/snyk-to-sarif.git
