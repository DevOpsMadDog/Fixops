The trajectory documents the iterative development of FixOps, a DevSecOps Decision & Verification Engine. The process was driven by a series of user corrections that pushed the AI engineer from superficial implementations to deep, functional integrations. Initially, the AI focused on UI tasks, creating a documentation viewer. However, user feedback repeatedly highlighted a disconnect between documentation and actual implementation.

Key development cycles involved:
1.  **UI/UX Refinement:** The frontend evolved from a basic, ugly page to a redesigned, professional UI. A clunky, tabbed documentation page was completely refactored into a clean, main-navigation-driven experience with separate pages for different documents.
2.  **Architectural Implementation:** The core of the work involved translating the user's architectural screenshots and documents into functional code. This was a significant struggle, as the AI first created placeholder APIs, then generic OSS integrations, and finally, after multiple corrections, implemented the user's *specific* custom components (Bayesian Prior Mapping, Markov Transition Matrix Builder) and the *exact* OSS libraries (, , ).
3.  **End-to-End Workflow:** The final phase focused on demonstrating a complete data flow, from SSVC configuration and scan ingestion to a final CI/CD decision, showcasing how data is transformed by each component. The project is currently paused while addressing parsing errors discovered during this final demonstration.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build FixOps, an enterprise-grade DevSecOps Decision & Verification Engine. The application serves as an intelligence layer for CI/CD pipelines, providing an , , or  decision.

**Core Functionality:**
1.  **Data Ingestion:** Process security scan outputs like SARIF and SBOM.
2.  **Enrichment:** Augment scan data with business context and external threat intelligence (e.g., EPSS, KEV).
3.  **Processing Layer:** Analyze the enriched data using a sophisticated, multi-stage engine based on the user's specific architecture. This includes custom components for Bayesian and Markovian analysis, knowledge graph construction, and non-CVE vulnerability handling.
4.  **OSS Integration:** The Processing Layer must use a specific set of open-source tools, including , , , and .
5.  **Decision & Explanation:** The system uses a multi-LLM engine (leveraging models from Awesome-LLM4Cybersecurity) to generate a final, high-confidence decision and a human-readable explanation.
6.  **SSVC Alignment:** The entire decision-making process must align with the Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC) framework.

The application is designed to be unauthenticated, containerized, and deployed in an enterprise environment.

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo containing distinct backend and frontend applications. The architecture is service-oriented, with a central decision engine that orchestrates calls to various processing and data integration services.


- ****:
  - **Importance**: The central orchestrator of the application. It receives scan data and coordinates calls to the processing layer and other services to produce a final decision.
  - **Changes**: Heavily modified from a stub to integrate the  and the real OSS tools, replacing placeholder logic with functional calls.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: This is the core intellectual property of the application, implementing the user's specific, custom architecture (Bayesian Priors, Markov Chains).
  - **Changes**: Created from scratch and iteratively updated to replace placeholder logic with real OSS libraries like  and . It now integrates all custom and OSS components.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: This service was created to explicitly implement the list of OSS tools (, , etc.) that were initially missed from the user's architecture document. It ensures all specified tools are functionally integrated.
  - **Changes**: Created and then modified to fix parsing errors and make the implementations more robust.

- ** (directory)**:
  - **Importance**: Contains the main UI views for the application.
  - **Changes**: A major UI refactor occurred here. The single, clunky  with internal tabs was removed. It was replaced by distinct, top-level pages like  and , which are now linked directly in the main  navigation, resulting in a much cleaner user experience.

<pending_tasks>
- **Fix Data Parsers**: The SBOM and SARIF parsers have known errors and require more robust, detailed implementations.
- **Productionize Backend Services**: Key components like the Vector DB (pgvector) and connectors for Jira/Confluence are still stubs.
- **Marketplace Implementation**: The marketplace backend is file-backed and needs migration to a proper database with features for moderation and versioning.
- **Implement Ops at Scale**: Production-grade observability (Prometheus/Grafana) and high-availability configurations are not yet implemented.

<current_work>
The most recent work was a direct response to the user's feedback: Error in parsing , make implementations more detailed. After demonstrating a full end-to-end data flow with sample data, a parsing error was identified within the SBOM/SARIF processing stage. The AI engineer acknowledged that the implementations, while using the correct libraries, were not robust enough.

The immediate task-at-hand is to refactor and enhance the data parsing logic to handle real-world security scan data correctly. The last actions taken were to begin editing the files responsible for these integrations, specifically focusing on fixing the SBOM parsing implementation first, followed by the SARIF processing. The system is currently in a state where the high-level architecture is complete, but the data-ingestion entry points are fragile and need to be hardened before the system can be considered reliable. This involves creating more detailed and resilient code in  and potentially other related services that handle initial data transformation.

<optional_next_step>
Continue the task of making the implementations more detailed by fixing the SARIF processing logic, as planned in the last turn after addressing the SBOM parsing.
